# Murine phylogenetics and discordance

This repo serves as a place for us authors to centralize our data and scripts.

It has several folders:

| Folder | Description | 
| ------ | ----------- |
| `data` | For storing data and scripts related to each part of the manuscript (see below). |
| `docs` | For any future web resources or documentation. |
| `figs` | The current figures for the manuscript. |
| `ms` | The current version of the manuscript, as well as the reference library (Endnote). |
| `tables` | The current tables for the manuscript. |

Each folder in data corresponds to a section of the manuscript. I've set up parts 2 and 3 with the following sub-folders:

| Sub-folder | Description | 
| ------ | ----------- |
| `data/<section>/data/` | The raw data files for this section (<100MB). |
| `data/<section>/figs/` | Any other figures not included in the main figs from this section. |
| `data/<section>/scripts/` | The scripts from this section to parse and analyze data. |
